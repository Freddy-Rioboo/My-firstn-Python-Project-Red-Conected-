## First project using Python

The main idea of this project was to create a Social Network using all Python elements that I learned only in Python.
For this reason, you will find in this repository 2 files. One of them contains all functions that I wrote for this project and in the other one, you will find the project built. Also, you may try it by just cloning the code.

## Description project:
In this section, I would like to comment on what this project does.

1-. In the beginning, the code asks for your name, then, it checks if you already have a profile. If you don't have one, the program starts asking you for some information to create your profile.

2-. The information required for your profile is: name, born date (with this calculate your age), tall, list of friends, also ask if you play any musical instrument and a little more.

3-. When your profile is already created, you might navigate to a menu to: update your data, add a friend, write a public message, change to another profile, si your friend's messages.

4-. All profile information is saved in a txt file with the user name, so when a user wants to get into the app, in the beginning, just write the name, and all your information is returned.

This project contains almost all of Python's elements like Functions, data type (str, bool, num), while and for loop, lists, methods, if statements, creating and importing modules, IDLE's debugger(I used the idle's debugger to fix some problems during the building process), nested loops, read and write files.

This was an incredible experience.
